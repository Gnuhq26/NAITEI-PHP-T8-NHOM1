## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to get the app up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

*   PHP >= 8.1
*   Composer
*   Node.js & NPM (or Yarn)
*   A database server (e.g., MySQL)

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/awesome-academy/NAITEI-PHP-T8-NHOM1.git
    cd NAITEI-PHP-T8-NHOM1
    ```

2.  **Install PHP Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3.  **Install JavaScript Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Open the `.env` file and update your database credentials, `APP_URL`, and any other necessary configurations (e.g., Google OAuth API keys).

    Generate an application key:
    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

5.  **Run Database Migrations:**
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

6.  **Seed the Database (Optional, for demo data):**
    ```bash
    php artisan db:seed
    ```

7.  **Start the Development Servers:**
    For the Laravel backend:
    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```
    For the Vite frontend assets:
    ```bash
    npm run dev # or yarn dev
    ```

    The application should now be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (or the `APP_URL` configured in your `.env` file).
